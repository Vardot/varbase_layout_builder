Feature: Varbase Layout Builder - login page
  As a visitor
  I want the login page to keep working with the Varbase Layout Builder stack
  enabled

  Scenario: The login page loads for an anonymous visitor
    Given I am an anonymous visitor
    When I am on "/user/login"
    Then "#user-login-form" should be visible
    And I should see "Log in"
    And I should not see "Page not found"
    And I should not see "The website encountered an unexpected error"
